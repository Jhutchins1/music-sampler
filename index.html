    <p id="intro">A brief introduction to the band:</p>

    <p>Coldplay is a British band composed of four instrumentalists. Led by singer Chris Martin, the band also includes guitarist Johnny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, and drummer Will Champion. This band is among the best-selling music groups of all time, winning multiple Grammys and other accolades from the very first album they ever released, "Parachutes". </p>
        
    <p>The band's popularity skyrocketed in the early 2000s, and they have maintained consistent success across two decades. They have collaborations with huge artists across different musical genres including Jay-Z, Rihanna, Big Sean, and Chris Martin even sang for Kanye West on his song "Homecoming". </p>

    <p>Coldplay even has global influence at this time. Their most recent world tour, "Music of the Spheres" is currently ongoing and will end in September 2024 after two years. Coldplay has a bid to go down as the greatest rock band of all time when it is all said and done. </p>

<hr class="break"> 

<p>Each of Coldplay's albums has a cohesive theme and a create a unique experience all the way through. Ghost Stories could be the album to put you to sleep, or contemplate late at night. Mylo Xyloto is full of an emotional rollercoaster of songs from anthems to lullabys. A Rush of Blood to the Head is Coldplay's second oldest album, showcasing some of the most acoustic work they have done.</p>

<p>For newer listeners, it is important to listen to how the band has evolved over time. Their seventh studio album, A Head Full of Dreams, uses more technological instruments and is less acoustic in nature. However, their first few albums were exclusively acoustic and sound like a younger version of the band Coldplay is today.</p>

If you'd like to know, my favorite album from Coldplay is Ghost Stories. The vocals from Chris Martin in this album are incredible.</p>
